## 🇧🇷 About the Project

**NoierUi** is a Brazilian project focused mainly on **Minecraft Bedrock Edition**.

It is still in active development, constantly improving layout structure, animation systems and visual refinement.

This entire project was built **100% on a mobile device**.

AI was used only to assist in JSON structure generation.  
All layout logic, visual design, alignment system and structure were created manually.

As the creator, I do **not** recommend relying 100% on AI for development, since it can make repeated technical mistakes.  
Understanding what you're building is essential.

## 🌠 Origin

NoierUi was born from a desire I had after seeing animated UIs like HorizonUI and BetmcUI.

Instead of waiting for better tools, I decided to use what I had available and make it real.

This project proves that with patience, effort and consistency, you can build anything — no matter the environment or tools.
